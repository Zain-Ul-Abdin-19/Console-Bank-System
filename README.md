# 💳 Z-U-A Bank — Java Banking Management System

Z-U-A Bank is a **desktop-based banking management system** built entirely in **Java Swing**.  
It provides a simple, file-driven simulation of a real-world banking environment — including secure login, account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking — all through an intuitive graphical interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Owner Login System**  
  Default credentials are automatically generated (`admin / admin123`).

- 👤 **Account Management**  
  Create new bank accounts with unique account numbers and store user data in text files.

- 💵 **Deposits & Withdrawals**  
  Perform secure transactions that update account balances dynamically.

- 📜 **Transaction History**  
  Each deposit or withdrawal is logged with a timestamp for audit purposes.

- 📂 **File-based Persistence**  
  All data is stored locally using text files (`User_Data.txt`, `Transaction_History.txt`, `Owner_login.txt`).

- 🪟 **Intuitive Swing UI**  
  Clean interface with modular panels, responsive layouts, and dialog-driven operations.
